Example 1: Differing Masses (M 1 M1, M 2 M2, M 3 M3) Input Parameters: 
M 1 equals 10.
kg M1 = 10 kg, M 2 = 5
kg M2 = 5 kg, M 3 = 8 kg
kg M3 = 8 kilogram
Observations: Because M1 is smaller in mass than M2 and M3, it accelerates more quickly.
M 2 M2 accelerates at an intermediate rate, while M 3 M3 accelerates at the least rate.
In conclusion, the bodies' acceleration is directly related to their mass, with lesser masses accelerating at a faster rate.

Example 2: Differing Friction Coefficients (μ 1 μ 1, μ 2 μ 2, μ 3 μ 3 ).
The input parameters are as follows: μ 1 = 0.1 μ 1 ​~ = 0.1, μ 2 = 0.2 μ 2 ​~ = 0.2, μ 3 = 0.3 μ 3 ​~ = 0.3
Notes:
Lower accelerations for the equivalent bodies are the result of higher coefficients of friction.
The reason for M1 M1's maximum acceleration is its lowest friction coefficient (μ 1 μ 1 ​).
In conclusion, friction significantly limits the bodies' accelerations, with larger coefficients of friction resulting in smaller accelerations.


Example 3: Different Rope Lengths (L L)
Entering Parameters: L = 10
m L = 10 m
Observations: A longer rope length causes M 1 M1 to move from its starting position a greater maximum distance (D D).
This is in line with the equation D = 1 2 a 1 L 2 / g D = 2 1 ​~ a 1 L 2 / g, where a 1 a 1 ​~ is the acceleration of M 1 M1.
In conclusion, the maximum distance that M1 M1 can travel is directly influenced by the length of the rope, with longer ropes permitting larger displacement.


Overall Findings: The system's behavior is greatly influenced by mass, friction coefficients, and rope length.
Larger maximum lengths traveled by the bodies and higher accelerations are caused by lower masses, lower coefficients of friction, and longer ropes.
We can learn more about the effects of different factors on the motion of the participating bodies by examining the system under various conditions. These results have practical implications for comprehending and forecasting the behavior of analogous physical systems.
